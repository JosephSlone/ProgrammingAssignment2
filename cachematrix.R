## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your

# Programming Notes:

#   (FYI - I put lots of comments in my code, mostly for my benefit)
#
#   < From the R manual >
#   The operators <<- and ->> are normally only used in functions,
#   and cause a search to made through parent environments for an
#   existing definition of the variable being assigned. If such a
#   variable is found (and its binding is not locked) then its value
#   is redefined, otherwise assignment takes place in the global
#   environment.


## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
